#wells: The automation machine

##Introduction
This document contains the software specifications for "The Wells Machine", a Haskell system for automating intelligent contracts.

It contains the elements that make up a state machine, an event machine and a time machine at the same time. There are three applied concepts that allow to program and execute automation tasks in the framework of a process flow. The wells machine would allow to evaluate past and future scenarios of the contract (forecast) at the same time of reversing or advancing phases of a previously established contract.
